This is a simple DND5e Foundry macro that checks if the player is in control of one token, no more and no less, and if so, it checks to see if they have at
least 1 gp (1 gold coin in in-game currency) and decreases it by 1 but increases their sp (silver coins in in-game currency) by 10, basically giving them change.

This is being used because I'm building a series of mini-games and dialog boxes that will cost the player 2 silvers, 3 silvers, etc. to proceed with and since some players may
not have any silver coins, but they do have gold coins, this will allow them to change gold to silvers.
