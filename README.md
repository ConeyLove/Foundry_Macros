These are 6 mini-games for D&D 5E that operate via dialog box. They each have names, descriptions, price to play, prize you can win, difficulty level, the attribute that the roll modifier uses, and a photo. The photos are available in another repository of this account.

If the player does not have any silver coins (that's what is used to pay for the games) it will try to convert 1 gold piece to 10 silver pieces if possible.

There is also a simple DND5e Foundry macro that checks if the player is in control of one token, no more and no less, and if so, it checks to see if they have at
least 1 gp (1 gold coin in in-game currency) and decreases it by 1 but increases their sp (silver coins in in-game currency) by 10, basically giving them change.
